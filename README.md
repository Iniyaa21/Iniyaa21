# 👋 Hey there! I'm Iniyaa

I'm a Computer Science student from India who loves building things with code and exploring the world of web development.  
Currently learning by experimenting, breaking things, and getting out of tutorial hell one day at a time 🧪💻

## 🚀 What I’m Currently Up To

- 🔭 Rebuilding my **gamified study app** using **React + Vite**, with XP for finishing tasks and AI-generated questions via **Mistral LLM**.
- 🧠 Getting better at **JavaScript**.
- ⚙️ Working with **Node.js + Express** to build backends for my personal projects.
- 💅 Creating clean, simple UIs with **Angular**, **Ionic**, and standalone components.
